joy4ge (Joystick for Google Earth) is a framework to connect any USB HID device (e.g. a Joystick) to an application that uses the 3DconnexionClient framework (e.g. Google Eath).

To download from github (http://github.com/stino/joy4ge), click on the "Downloads" link in the upper right, click "Download as zip", and get a zip file.

To compile open project in XCode(last testet with 6.2) and use build. The compiled framework will be placed under ~/Library/Frameworks/3DconnexionClient.framework/ . 

With Google Earth 6.0 for OSX it sould work out of the box.
But with Google Earth 7.1 for OSX you have to open the App-Bundle-Flie of Google Earth first and go to Contents/Frameworks/ and rename the 3DconnexionClient.framework the to an other name.
For some reason Google has placed the original Framework of 3Dconnexion there, but this version will only work with devces of 3Dconnexion. Since in the App-Bundle is the first seach place of the OSX you have the rename it,
and than the version under ~/Library/Framework should be used. If you have installed an official driver of 3Dconnexion you may have to do more renames in /Library/Framework/ to disable original framework there too.
But if you have an original 3D-Mouse of 3Dconnexion you will not need joy4ge ;-) .

When the joy4ge framework is active (means you installed it correct an start Google Earth) and you have pluged in an USB HID device to your computer you should see in the Apple Console Log entries like this:
12.08.15 08:44:13,224 Google Earth[2885]: InstallConnexionHandlers()
12.08.15 08:44:13,225 Google Earth[2885]: RegisterConnexionClient(signature = 45727468, name = (null), mode = 0001, mask = 00003F00)
12.08.15 08:44:14,281 Google Earth[2885]: HID device plugged: PS3/PC Adaptor
12.08.15 08:44:14,282 Google Earth[2885]: Number of detected axis: 4
12.08.15 08:44:14,282 Google Earth[2885]: Number of detected buttons: 12

For each detected device during the joy4ge framework is active it will append an entry for each USB HID device in the file ~/Library/Application Support/3DconnexionClient/controller.config.plist .
In this file a kind of default mapping is used if you plug an device for the first time. This default mapping is from my USB-to-PS2-Controller and for sure not correct for your device.
But you can change controller.config.plist with an editor and change the mapping and also the the axis dead zone calibration of your own device. This is very tricky i know an you have to look in to source code to understand all entries.
Well I know I need to describe the controller.config.plist a bit better in future. And much better will be an GUI application to do this, but at moment I have no experience how to develop such an GUI Applicatio a bit better in future. 
And much better will be an GUI application to do this, but at moment I have no time to develop such an GUI Application. You can join the project and support me if you want. :-)
